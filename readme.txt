caffeine
===============================================================================


Run this to prevent your PC screen from locking.  It does this by simulating
that you've used the F15 key once every 59 seconds.

Double-click the icon to temporarily disable Caffeine, and permit your screen
to lock.

Under Win98:      a key down and then a key up event is simulated
Under Win2000/XP: a key up event is simulated

The additional event is required under Windows 98, otherwise the screen will
still lock.
